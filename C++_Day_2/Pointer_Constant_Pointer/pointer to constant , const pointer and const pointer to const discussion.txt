pointer to constant
constant pointer
constant pointer to a constant

a) pointer to constant

meaning:
	pointer can point to const as well as non-const member.
using pointer variable you cannot change the value of a variable to which pointer is pointing.
can we change the pointer?
	yes u can change the pointer ( as it is not a constant pointer)

syntax:

const datatype *pointervariable
	or
datatype const *pointervariable


// with non-const member

int num = 100;  // non-const member
//const int *ptr;  // pointer to constant
int const* ptr;    // pointer to constant
ptr = &num;
cout << num << "\t" << *ptr << endl;
// *ptr = 200;  // not allowed
num = 200;
cout << num << "\t" << *ptr << endl;


// with const member


const int num = 100;  // const member
//const int *ptr;  // pointer to constant
int const* ptr;    // pointer to constant
ptr = &num;
cout << num << "\t" << *ptr << endl;
// *ptr = 200;  // not allowed
// num = 200;  // not allowed
cout << num << "\t" << *ptr << endl;
ptr++;  // allowed


b) constant pointer

meaning:
	pointer cannot be changed but using pointer we can change the variable where it is pointing. Can point to non-const member. but cannot point to const member.

syntax:

datatype * const pointervariable=address;

// with non-const member


int num = 100;  // non-const member
int* const ptr = &num;  // constant pointer
cout << num << "\t" << *ptr << endl;
*ptr = 200;  //  allowed
cout << num << "\t" << *ptr << endl;
num = 300;
cout << num << "\t" << *ptr << endl;
// ptr++;  // not allowed


const int num = 100;  // const member
int* const ptr = &num;  // not allowed


c) constant pointer to a constant

meaning:
	neither pointer can be changed nor the value of a variable can be changed using the pointer. It's like a read-only pointer. can point to const as well as non const member.

syntax:

const datatype * const pointervariable=address
	or
datatype const * const pointervariable=address

// with non-const member

int num = 100;  // non-const member
const int* const ptr = &num;
cout << num << "\t" << *ptr << endl;
// *ptr = 20;   // not allowed
// ptr++;   // not allowed
num = 20;  // allowed
cout << num << "\t" << *ptr << endl;


// with const-member

const int num = 100;  // non-const member
const int* const ptr = &num;
cout << num << "\t" << *ptr << endl;
// *ptr = 20;   // not allowed
// ptr++;   // not allowed
// num = 20;  // not allowed
cout << num << "\t" << *ptr << endl;
